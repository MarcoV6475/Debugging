# Debugging_Description
In CSS-225 we read a chapter learning about the different types of errors found in coding those being: Parse errors, Type error, Name error, and Value error.
We were given seven files that were full of errors.
I was tasked to go through each file and apply my knowledge about the types of errors and print statements to debug each file.
I was able to resolve each file with the help of the type errors and print statements!
